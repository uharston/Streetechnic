      <h1> Dream Big</h1>

    <p> Not every story starts out with epic beginnings. In fact, most stories usually go untold and fade into the past. </p>

    <p> Early years of life was full of hopefully realities. This 1984 Toyota Corolla Hatchback that was donated to my mom and then gifted to 17 year old me was the only outlet to channel my ambitions.</p>

    <p> What felt like years of the JDM dream had finally begun. Work commenced right away in 'improving' or 'customizing' what ever my part time high school job could afford or by using what was already in a friend's Autozone-like garage. (Red painted lug-nuts definetly happened.)

    <p>Things definetly got worse before they got better. Removing the dash is not for the faint at heart, but sometimes it is for those who are "broke" but still have a dream..</p>

    <p>I am enternally grateful that a $20 Chevy Nova dash from U Pull that perfectly replaced the "sun-dried tomato" dash from before.</p>

    <p>Oh yea, the paint situation at one point was should I say "less than stellar". Painting a car with no experience is a feat accomplished by very few. </p>

    <p> After a long wait the glorious paint job arrived. The paint was actually a gift from a friend. I am grateful as the self-made paint dream was a struggle I was not ready for.  </p>

    <p> After having everything break on my Corolla, I became quite good around Toyota's in general and picked up this '79 Toyota Corolla Wagon along the way </p>
